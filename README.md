# ForDot.

## Desicription

ForDot. is a revolutionary tool to help vehicle owners maintain and care for their vehicles. Through a simplistic and clean design, simple notifications, and a friendly persona representing their car, ForDot. encourages vehicles owners to not only care for the persona but also their car. It keeps vehicles coming back to take care of ForDot using slick animations, a modern interface, and easy-to-use controls. Upon connecting to the vehicle, Dot, the avatar, begins its journey. As the vheicle is driven, the status of the car and Dot changes. The vehicle owner needs to care for the vehicle to better the conditions for ForDot.

## Inspiration

Cars and vehicles, being one of the largest forms of transportation in the world, require maintenance as they are used. However, according to a study, as much as 68% of cars currently have at least one issue with them. Many of these problems can be solved with a simple fix or a quick visit to a repair shop. If neglected, this can lead to vehicle owners spending thousands of dollars on repairs or even requiring owners to retire their vehicle and purchase a new one. The aim of ForDot. is aid vehicle owners in maintaining and caring for the vehicles.
